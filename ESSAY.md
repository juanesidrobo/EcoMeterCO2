I am an **Electronic Engineering student** with a deep passion for building software that solves real-world problems. With a background in Telematics and Software Development, I have spent the last year exploring mobile development, focusing on declarative UI and cross-platform architectures. Outside of coding, I am an avid football fan and an **AI enthusiast**; this interest in algorithms inspired me to merge technology with environmental awareness through smart personalization.

The idea for EcoMeterCO2 was born from frustration. I realized that most carbon footprint apps are overly complex, demanding too much input for abstract results. I wanted to build a tool that respects the user's time—capturing data in under 60 seconds—and focuses on behavioral change. Instead of guilt-tripping users, EcoMeterCO2 provides transparency ("How we estimated it") and offers one "Tiny Action" per day, gamifying the journey toward sustainability.

Technologically, EcoMeterCO2 is a showcase of **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**. As a student developer, KMP allowed me to build for two platforms simultaneously without compromising quality. I aimed to maximize code sharing, not just for business logic but for the UI as well. By using **Compose Multiplatform**, I achieved a ~90% shared codebase between Android and Web (Wasm/JS). The architecture relies on clean domain separation: a deterministic calculation engine using `kotlinx-serialization` for data and `kotlinx-datetime` for temporal logic.

One of the project's highlights is the "Tiny Action Engine," a lightweight algorithm that personalizes recommendations based on the user's history. This runs entirely on-device using a "Local-First" approach, ensuring privacy without needing a backend.

Developing EcoMeterCO2 demonstrated that KMP is mature enough to allow a single developer to build beautiful, responsive apps across mobile and web. It turns the complex global challenge of climate change into a manageable, daily habit, powered entirely by Kotlin.
